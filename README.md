# About application

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. This application clearly shows the value in testing, as it tests the application for a series of checks to make sure all tests are passed.


## Why this Application?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important application to have!


## How to run the application


To run this application load the index.html in a modern web browser that supports HTML5. Load the index.html in a modern web browser that supports HTML5, served from a web server.
